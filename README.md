# Surrogate-assisted-multi-obj-optimization-algorithm-with-dimensionality-reduction
My surrogate model-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithm featuring hierarchical constraint-based dimensionality reduction for DATE 2026 conference.
Due to commercial confidentiality reasons, scripts for process libraries and commercial EDA tools cannot be included with the code. Therefore, MBFF_delect. py has been changed to several functions for testing purposes.
To run this project, it is necessary to download the pyGRNN package in advance
